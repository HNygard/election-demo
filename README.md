# Online Election Demo

This is a demonstration application that showcases potential vulnerabilities and security challenges in web-based voting systems. The purpose of this project is educational, aiming to highlight why online voting in democratic elections requires careful consideration.

## Purpose

This demo illustrates common security concerns and technical challenges that make online voting problematic for democratic elections. It serves as a practical example of why many cybersecurity experts are cautious about implementing internet voting for official elections.

This application is connected to my talk on election security. I don't think it makes sense all by itself without the associated "flair" on stage.

## ðŸš¨ Important Notice

This is a demonstration tool only. It should NOT be used for actual elections or voting purposes. The vulnerabilities shown are intentional for educational purposes.

## (TODO) Security Concerns Demonstrated

- Potential for vote manipulation
    - I will manipulated the published result.
- Issues with voter anonymity
    - I will show snippet of the logs with details like IP,
      browser, etc
- Exclusion of some groups
    - Example: Exclude based on network (Telenor mobil or other large carrier in Norway)
    - Example: Exclude based on brower (Ios devices get error)

Might be cut for time:
- Vote verification
    - Give a verification code at the end. Can supposablity
    use it to verify that your vote was part of the result.
    - Can you trust the verification?
    - Who can verify the veriication? A handful of people? Is that good for trust in the election?

- Voter authentication challenges

## Educational Value

This project helps:
- Election officials understand technical risks
- Developers learn about security challenges
- Students explore cybersecurity concepts
- Demonstrate why traditional voting methods remain important

## Disclaimer

This application intentionally contains vulnerabilities for educational purposes. Do not use any code from this project in production systems or real election applications.
